## Ghostty Jellybeans Theme
To use this theme:
1. Navigate to your Ghostty config directory (usually $HOME/.config/ghostty)
2. Inside the Ghostty config directory, create a directory named `themes` if it does not exist already.  
Save the colorscheme file - `jellybeans` (dark) or `jellybeans-light` (light) in this directory  
You can choose either file based on your preference.
3. Edit the Ghostty config file, (usually $HOME/.config/ghostty/config) and append one of the following lines:  
- For the dark theme:
```
theme = jellybeans
```
- For the light theme:
```
theme = jellybeans-light
```
